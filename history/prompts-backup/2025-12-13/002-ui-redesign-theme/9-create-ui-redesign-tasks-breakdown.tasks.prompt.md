## Prompt


## Response snapshot

Successfully created a comprehensive task breakdown for the UI redesign and theme enhancement with 40 specific tasks organized across 7 phases:

1. Phase 1: Setup (3 tasks) - Preparation activities
2. Phase 2: Foundational (5 tasks) - Design token system and theme infrastructure
3. Phase 3: User Story 1 - Modern Visual Identity (7 tasks) - P1 priority
4. Phase 4: User Story 2 - Enhanced User Experience (5 tasks) - P2 priority
5. Phase 5: User Story 3 - Responsive Design (5 tasks) - P1 priority
6. Phase 6: User Story 4 - Theme Customization (5 tasks) - P2 priority
7. Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (10 tasks) - Final validation

The tasks follow the required format with proper IDs, parallelization markers [P], and user story labels [US1-US4]. Each task is specific enough to be actionable by a developer while preserving all existing functionality. The plan maintains the priority order from the specification (P1 stories implemented before P2 stories) and includes parallel execution opportunities to optimize development time.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created detailed task breakdown with 40 specific tasks across 7 phases
- 🧪 Tests: No formal tests needed (UI redesign task)
- 📁 Files: 6 files referenced/created (tasks.md, spec.md, plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation execution
- 🧠 Reflection: Task breakdown enables systematic implementation preserving functionality

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation of Phase 1 tasks
