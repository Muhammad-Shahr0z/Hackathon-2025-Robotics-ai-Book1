## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive implementation tasks for the RAG chatbot backend with OpenAI Agents, organized by user story priority. The tasks include:
- Phase 1: Setup tasks for project initialization
- Phase 2: Foundational tasks for shared components
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Document ingestion and storage
- Phase 4: User Story 2 - Contextual chat interaction with OpenAI Agents
- Phase 5: User Story 3 - Vector search and retrieval
- Phase 6: User Story 4 - Multi-document support and context management
- Phase 7: Polish and cross-cutting concerns

All tasks follow the required checklist format with IDs, story labels, and specific file paths.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created detailed task list for RAG chatbot backend implementation
- 🧪 Tests: All tasks follow required format with proper IDs, labels, and file paths
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with 72 implementation tasks organized by phase
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation following the task list
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user story priority with dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
