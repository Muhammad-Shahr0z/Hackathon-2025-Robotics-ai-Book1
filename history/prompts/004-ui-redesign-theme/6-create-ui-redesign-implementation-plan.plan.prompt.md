## Prompt

Continue with implementation planning for UI redesign based on the specification created.

## Response snapshot

Successfully created a comprehensive implementation plan for the UI redesign and theme enhancement of the AI and robotics learning platform. The plan includes:

- Architecture decisions for CSS custom properties, component-based styling, and mobile-first responsive design
- Implementation strategy organized in 5 phases:
  1. Foundation Setup (P0) - Design tokens and theme infrastructure
  2. Core Component Redesign (P1) - Buttons, inputs, cards, modals, etc.
  3. Layout and Responsive Design (P1) - Grid systems and mobile layouts
  4. Theme Variants Implementation (P2) - Alternative color schemes
  5. Integration and Testing (P1) - Integration and validation

The plan includes 28 specific tasks (T001-T028), technical approach, risk analysis, dependencies, success metrics, rollout strategy, and team responsibilities. All requirements from the specification have been addressed with a systematic implementation approach that preserves existing functionality while implementing the modern, tech-inspired theme.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created detailed implementation plan with 5 phases and 28 tasks
- 🧪 Tests: No formal tests needed (planning task)
- 📁 Files: 2 files created/updated - plan.md and referenced spec.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for task breakdown and implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan addresses all specification requirements with proper risk mitigation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Create detailed task list based on implementation plan
