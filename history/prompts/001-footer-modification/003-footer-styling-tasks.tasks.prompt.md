## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive tasks for the footer styling modification feature. The tasks.md file includes:

- Setup phase (T001-T003) for environment preparation
- Foundational phase (T004-T007) for examining current footer structure
- User Story 1 phase (T008-T014) implementing the blue background (#2563EB) with white text
- Polish phase (T015-T023) for verification and quality assurance

The tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. The implementation strategy focuses on an MVP approach starting with User Story 1 (Enhanced Footer Visibility). All tasks are designed to be independently executable and testable, with clear acceptance criteria based on the specification.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete task breakdown for footer styling implementation
- 🧪 Tests: N/A for task generation phase
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with 23 specific, actionable tasks
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation phase
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user story with proper dependencies and parallelization notes
