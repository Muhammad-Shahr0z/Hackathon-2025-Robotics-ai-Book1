prompt_text: "$ARGUMENTS"
response_text: "Created comprehensive implementation plan for fixing the Docusaurus language switch issue. The plan includes: 1) Technical context with Docusaurus v3.x specifics, 2) Constitution check passing all required gates, 3) Research document analyzing root causes and best practices, 4) Data model defining configuration structures, 5) Quickstart guide with step-by-step implementation, 6) API contract defining expected behavior. All artifacts follow the SpecKit Plus methodology and align with the project constitution."
outcome: "Planning phase completed successfully with all required artifacts created. The plan addresses the core issue of malformed URLs during language switching and provides a clear path for implementation using Docusaurus built-in i18n features."
evaluation: "The implementation plan is comprehensive and addresses all aspects of the language switching fix. The constitution check passes all required gates, ensuring alignment with project principles. The research document provides sufficient technical analysis to guide implementation, and the supporting artifacts (data model, quickstart, contracts) provide clear guidance for development."
