response_text: "Created comprehensive task list for the Docusaurus language switch fix. The tasks are organized by phases: Setup (T001-T004), Foundational (T005-T008), User Story 1 - core language switching (T009-T014), User Story 2 - idempotent switching (T015-T020), User Story 3 - RTL layout (T021-T026), and Polish phase (T027-T033). The tasks follow the checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and parallelization markers. The MVP scope covers User Story 1 (core functionality)."
outcome: "Task generation completed successfully with 33 specific, actionable tasks organized by user story priority. Each task follows the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths where applicable. The implementation strategy prioritizes the core routing fix first (MVP) followed by supporting features."
evaluation: "The tasks are well-organized by phases and user stories, with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified. Each task is specific enough to be executed independently while contributing to the overall goal of fixing the malformed URL issue during language switching. The checklist format ensures proper tracking and execution."
