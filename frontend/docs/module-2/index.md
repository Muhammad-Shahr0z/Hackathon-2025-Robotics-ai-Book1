# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

**Focus**: Physics simulation and environment building.

---

## Overview

This module teaches you how to create digital twins of robots and environments. You'll learn to simulate physics, build realistic worlds, and integrate high-fidelity rendering for human-robot interaction studies.

---

## What You Will Learn

- Simulating physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo
- High-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity
- Simulating sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs
- Building realistic environments for robot testing

---

## Chapters

### Chapter 4: Camera Systems and Image Processing in ROS 2

Process visual data from cameras to enable robot perception.

### Chapter 5: Lidar and Depth Sensing: Building Point Clouds

Use Lidar and depth cameras to create 3D representations of the environment.

### Chapter 6: Sensor Fusion: Combining Data for Robust Perception

Integrate multiple sensors to create a comprehensive understanding of the environment.
