# Chapter 1: Introduction to Embodied AI and Robotics

**Description**: Explore the fundamental concepts of embodied intelligence and the role of robotics in the physical world.

---

## Topics

### What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to AI systems that:
- Function in the real world, not just digital environments
- Comprehend physical laws (gravity, friction, momentum)
- Interact with objects and navigate spaces
- Learn from physical interactions

### From Digital AI to Embodied Intelligence

The transition from purely digital AI systems to robots that understand and interact with the physical world represents a fundamental shift in artificial intelligence.

### The Humanoid Robotics Landscape

Overview of current humanoid robots and their capabilities:
- Boston Dynamics Atlas
- Tesla Optimus
- Figure 01
- Unitree H1 and G1

### Why Humanoid Robots Matter

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they:
- Share our physical form
- Can navigate human environments
- Can be trained with abundant data from human interactions
- Represent the ultimate expression of embodied intelligence

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Explain the principles of embodied intelligence
- Understand the difference between digital AI and Physical AI
- Identify key players in the humanoid robotics landscape
- Articulate why humanoid form factor is advantageous

---

## Key Takeaways

- Physical AI extends AI capabilities into the real world
- Embodied intelligence requires understanding of physical laws
- Humanoid robots leverage our human-centered infrastructure
