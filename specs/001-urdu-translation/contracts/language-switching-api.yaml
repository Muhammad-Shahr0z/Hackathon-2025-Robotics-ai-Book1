# API Contract: Language Switching for Urdu Translation Feature

## Overview
This contract defines the expected behavior for language switching functionality between English and Urdu in the Docusaurus-based textbook.

## Endpoints
Since this is a Docusaurus static site with client-side i18n, the "API" is primarily the configuration and file structure that enables language switching.

### Configuration Contract
```
docusaurus.config.js
├── i18n.defaultLocale: 'en'
├── i18n.locales: ['en', 'ur']
├── i18n.localeConfigs.en.label: 'English'
├── i18n.localeConfigs.en.direction: 'ltr'
├── i18n.localeConfigs.ur.label: 'اردو'
└── i18n.localeConfigs.ur.direction: 'rtl'
```

### File Structure Contract
```
i18n/
└── ur/
    └── docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/
        └── current/
            └── [mirrors English docs structure]
```

## Expected Behaviors

### 1. Language Switching
- When user selects Urdu from locale dropdown → entire site content switches to Urdu
- When user selects English from locale dropdown → entire site content switches to English
- URL updates to reflect language (e.g., /ur/docs/intro for Urdu)
- Navigation maintains selected language context

### 2. RTL Layout
- When Urdu is selected → layout switches to right-to-left
- When English is selected → layout switches to left-to-right
- Text alignment, navigation flow, and UI elements adjust accordingly

### 3. Content Preservation
- English content remains unchanged when Urdu is added
- Code blocks remain in English regardless of selected language
- Technical terminology preserved in English with optional Urdu explanations

### 4. SEO & Navigation
- URLs are language-specific (e.g., /docs/intro for English, /ur/docs/intro for Urdu)
- Internal links respect current language selection
- Default language is English unless user explicitly selects Urdu

## Validation Criteria
1. Language toggle appears in navbar
2. Content switches completely between languages
3. RTL layout works properly for Urdu
4. All links work in selected language
5. English content remains unchanged
6. Code blocks stay in English
7. URLs reflect selected language
